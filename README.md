This is the old version of my Website. The current one is the [Portfolio - React Native](https://github.com/rgero/PortfolioRN) repository. I intend on doing all future development there.


--- Old Readme.md ---

This repository is essentially the gist of my website. The goal of it is to create a website that people can go to and quickly access all of my published projects, whether they are a subdomain of my website, a game hosted on Itch.io or something else along those lines.
