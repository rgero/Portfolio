It was originally a recommendation from my therapist to keep track of my personal wins, no matter the size.\n\nThis led me to explore writing it in React, and storing the data in Supabase. It's been a pretty useful tool for me because I can easily go back to see, sort or search them when I am feeling a bit low about a certain aspect of my life.\n\n",

    "description": "Fajita is a project that a friend and I worked on together. Its purpose is to be a tool that our friends use during our weekly hang outs to manage a queue of YouTube videos. We thought it would be fun to derive stats, such as the most played video, who queued the most videos, who was most likely to use their \"Play Next\", and  things of that nature.\n\nAs we discussed this, we wanted to mimic a lot of the functionality that you would see through the YouTube mobile app, and at the end of the night generate a playlist that our friends could reference at a later time.\n\n#### Current Features in the Fajita Front End\n* Search YouTube for videos\n* Add videos to the end of the queue\n* Add a video to the queue and have it play next (effectively skipping the queue)\n* Delete videos from the queue\n* Skip to a different video in the queue\n* Control the playback of the video\n* Announce to everyone that you've added a video\n* Secretly add a video so that no one can see it until it is played\n* Copy the URL of a video to your device's clipboard so you can save it for later.\n\nAll of these actions communicate to a custom back end, which then emits a websocket event to keep all devices connected in sync with each other.",

    "description": "This was a game, based on Mario Kart, designed to be incredibly frustrating to my friend Josh as a donation incentive for Extra Life. It was one of the first projects I worked on with some friends and had a lot of cool things that I'm really proud about.\n\n#### Features\n* An integration with Twitch's chat. This was used to trigger pranks. Those pranks included:\n    * Flipping the camera so the car was on the ceiling\n    * Flipping the controls so that you had to press right to turn left.\n    * Making the track invisible\n    * Sending a message from Twitch chat to be displayed on screen\n----\n### Videos\nThis is a playlist of the Painbow Road videos as it was initially being developed. There has since been several iterations, I just don't have videos of that.\n\n[![Painbow Road Playlist](https://img.youtube.com/vi/nWw4V2r_5Zc/2.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOaTPE4td0A1apqnBlTkttm4Xi20LAFDt)",

    "description": "This is a small project in which I quickly recreated the Suika Fruit game, a popular game that's on the Nintendo Switch and the Web. It was meant to be something that I worked on over the holidays.\n\nThe goal wasn't to recreate the game in its entirety, but to replicate the game mechanics. Once that was achieved, the progress on this stalled a fair bit. I might revisit this further to make the graphics a bit better, or to experiment with some other features.",
