### 2024-02-12 - Initial Notes
*What data from the projects will I need?*

 - Name of the project
 - Link to the Repo
 - Link to the website if it is deployed
 - Images/Videos
 -- Where are these going to be stored? Videos can probably be stored on the personal YouTube (similar to how the old projects were stored). Images though, maybe in Supabase if I do that?
 - Technologies? These might be tags that can be searchable later.
 - Description
 - Dates?

*How should it be presented?*
Honestly I am sort of thinking that a simple bootstrap Accordion might be the answer here. That way the minimal amount of data is displayed to the user and if they want to, it can be expanded or even directed to the unique page for that project.

I'm envisioning the following:
#### Information when the project is closed
|Project Name|Tags|Expand|  
|--|--|--|
|Test Project|React, Javascript, Supabase| Expand|
| Test Project 2 | React Native, Javascript, Firebase | Expand |
|Project 3| Unity, C#, Blender| Expand|


#### Information when project is Open
> Project Title | Tags
> ----------------------------
> Brief Description
> Link to full project page.


#### Full Page for Project
> Project Title
> ---
> *Tags*:  Fancy Tag, Tag 2, Tag 3
>
> Description
> Videos/Images

Then a box on the right side that shows links

I'm not sure if this going to be the final design, but with the dummy data I should be able to mock this up and see if I like it.
